# micro-http-router
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/protocol114/micro-http-router.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/protocol114/micro-http-router) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/protocol114/micro-http-router/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/protocol114/micro-http-router?branch=master)

micro-http-router is a simple, Express-like router for [micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro) that uses a radix tree via [radix-router](https://github.com/charlieduong94/radix-router). It supports most, if not all, of the HTTP verbs, and tries to be as lightweight and quick as possible.

## Installation
micro-http-router is an npm package and you should have the latest Node.js and npm installed.

```bash
> npm i --save micro-http-router
```

https://www.npmjs.com/package/micro-http-router

## Usage

```javascript
const micro = require('micro');
const Router = require('micro-http-router');

// Initialize the router
const router = new Router();

// Define a basic GET request
router.route({
    path: '/',
    method: 'GET',
    handler: (req, res) => {
        return 'Hello, world';
    }
});

// Define a basic GET request with a middleware function
router.route({
    path: '/',
    method: 'GET',
    before: (req, res) => {
        req.user = {};
        req.user.name = 'John Doe';
    },
    handler: (req, res) => {
        return `Hello, ${ req.user.name }`;
    }
});

// Express-like routing helpers
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    return 'Hello, world';
});

// Async body parsing
router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
    const body = await micro.json(req);
    return body;
});

// Any number of route parameters are supported
// Access via the req.params array
router.get('/:first/:second', (req, res) => {
    const first = req.params.first;
    const second = req.params.second;
    return `Your first parameter is ${ first } and your second is ${ second }.`;
});

// Start micro and listen
const server = micro((req, res) => router.handle(req, res));
const port = 3000;
server.listen(port);
console.log(`micro is listening on port: ${ port }`);
```

## Changelog (1.3.0 => 1.4.0)

##### New in 1.4.0
Added support for query parameters using WHATWG URL API. The WHATWG URL `.searchParams` object gets transplanted onto the `request` object as `.searchParams` as well for a familiar API for retrieving and manipulating those query parameters.

##### New in 1.3.0
Updated dependencies, including radix-router. The only major change is that in place of a request parameter array, the parameters are added to the `req.params` object in a named fashion. If you define a route as `'/:id'`, instead of using `req.params[0]` to get the passed in ID, you can simply use `req.params.id`. Additionally, merged in [PR #3](https://github.com/protocol114/micro-http-router/pull/3) which adds a full stack trace to the error output when `debug` is set to `true`.

##### New in 1.2.0
Add `debug: true` to the router options object to enable debug logging. Any thrown errors will have their error messages returned as the response body. Useful when developing with micro-http-router and you are unexpectedly receiving 500 Internal Server Errors.

##### New in 1.1.0
Added `before` option to route options. This serves as a single layer of middleware allowing you to do the following:

```javascript
const micro = require('micro');
const Router = require('micro-http-router');

const beforeHandler = function (req, res) {
    req.user = {};
    req.user.name = 'John Doe';
};

// Initialize the router
const router = new Router();

// Define a basic GET request with a middleware function
router.route({
    path: '/',
    method: 'GET',
    before: beforeHandler,
    handler: (req, res) => {
        return `Hello, ${ req.user.name }`;
    }
});

// or define it with your get shorthand
router.get('/', beforeHandler, (req, res) => {
    return `Hello, ${ req.user.name }`;
});

// Start micro and listen
const server = micro((req, res) => router.handle(req, res));
const port = 3000;
server.listen(port);
console.log(`micro is listening on port: ${ port }`);
```

## Tests
`micro-http-router` comes with a few [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) tests to help ensure correct routing behavior.

To execute the tests yourself, simply run:

`npm test`
